##Alohar Demo##

This open source project demonstrates how to integrate Alohar SDK into your iOS and Android application.

###About Alohar###

Mobile phones are smart today, but they can be even smarter with the Alohar Ambient Analytics platform. Mobile apps running the Alohar SDK can automatically understand a smartphone user's behavior thanks to the SDK’s persistent sensing technology and Alohar cloud-based analytics services. Using minimal battery, Alohar-powered apps can also determine the places a user visits without requiring manual check-ins. Mobile app developers are using the Alohar platform now to create smart personal assistants, games, health, fitness, safety, transportation, dating and shopping apps.

###Main Features###

The Alohar Mobile Ambient Analytics Platform enables ambient location apps. In other words, it efficiently collects location and other mobile sensor data and quickly analyzes it to understand a smartphone user’s behavior. It achieves this while using the minimal amount of battery necessary on the mobile device. The platform is composed of a smartphone client SDK (software development kit) for Android and iPhone and several cloud-based services. The platform uses mobile location, motion, direction, Wi-Fi and timing data to learn about the mobile user in real time and over time. Therefore it provides more advanced functionality than a conventional mobile LBS (location based services) platform. 

*Here are just a few things you can do with the platform:*

+ Automatically detect the places (including the name and category) that the user visits.
+ Minimize battery power consumption while gathering data from the mobile device.
+ Get notifications when a user arrives at or departs from a place.
+ Automatically get the number of times a user visits a place, and how much time is spent there per visit.
+ Automatically understand a user’s mobile motion state (e.g. stationary, walking or driving).


###Getting Started###

Go to [Alohar's Developer](http://www.alohar.com/developer) get a free developer account.
Download latest SDK and sample app.

###Sample Applications###

This SDK comes with a sample application that demonstrates authorization, making API calls to guide you in development. It aalso shows case how to our platform works behides the scenes.

To build and run the iOS sample application with XCode:

+ Open the included XCode Project File by selecting iOS/aloharDemo.xcodeproj.
+ Select Build->Build and Run. This should compile the application and launch it.

*NOTE*: our iOS SDK requires OS5.0+ and XCode4.2+. our Android SDK require OS2.2+.
